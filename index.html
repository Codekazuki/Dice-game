        <h1>So how do you play Pig?</h1>
        <br />

        <p>
          * Player 1 go first. <br />
          <br />
          * That player throws a die and scores as many points as the total
          shown on the die providing the die doesn’t roll a 1. The player may
          continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end
          his turn. <br />
          <br />
          * If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over, he loses all points he
          accumulated that turn, and he passes the die to the next player.
          <br />
          <br />
          *Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined.
        </p>

        <h1>How do you win the game?</h1>
        <br />

        <p>The first player to accumulate 100 or more points wins the game.</p>
